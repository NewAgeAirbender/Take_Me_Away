# Take_Me_Away

Created with Black Books in mind, this app creates a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. Retrieves and manipulate this information to provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at the station.
